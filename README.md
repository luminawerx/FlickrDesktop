# Flickr Desktop

Flickr Desktop is a simple Windows application that automatically fetches and displays Flickr images as your desktop background. It can download public pictures or private images from your account (API Key required for this), refreshing your wallpaper at set intervals to keep your desktop fresh and dynamic.
